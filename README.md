# cpp-data-structure-uni-classes
A Data Structure repo in C++ for my college last period classes of my System Analysis and Development graduation course.


How it's being built and ran:

- VSCode
- Install the C++ extension for VS Code
- $ gcc -v //check if and the version of installed gcc
- CTRL+SHIFT+B // to open the task.json
- C/C++: g++ build active file // Click on this option
- Click on the terminal then press any key on the keyboard
- Then on terminal type the name of your program like program_name.cpp just like this ./program_name and then hit enter
- So you must be able to visualize the results on terminal at this point
